# Selene

## Building the library

### General

**Selene** uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for building.

Follow the usual instructions for CMake projects on UNIX-like systems.
First, clone the project and create a `build` directory (or use another name).

    git clone https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene.git
    cd selene
    mkdir build && cd build

Then call `cmake` and build the project. Using [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), and with all optional
parts enabled (see below for required dependencies):

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make

Alternatively, using [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/):

    cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    ninja

On Windows, the CMake command might look similar to the following, in order to generate Visual Studio 2017 project
files for a 64-bit build (see below for more info on [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)):

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -T "host=x64" \
        -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path_to_vcpkg>\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake \
        ..

#### Static vs. shared libraries

The default settings will build a set of static libraries.

If you want to build shared libraries instead, add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` to the `cmake` command.

### Installation

The easiest option is to use the library as a submodule within your project.
No actual installation is needed then, and Selene will be built from source together with your project.
Integrating the library into own CMake projects can be as easy as:

    add_subdirectory(selene)  # assuming the library is cloned as submodule in a directory named 'selene'
    # ...
    target_link_libraries(<target_name> selene::selene)

Advantages of this approach are greatly decreased risk of inconsistent dependencies (in case you upgrade libraries),
and IDEs more easily picking up the Selene source code.
This can be particularly useful when developing on Selene itself.

Alternatively, you can install Selene (e.g. using `make install`) and then declare as dependency in a CMake project
as follows:

    find_package(selene)
    # ...
    target_link_libraries(<target_name> selene::selene)

To provide a custom installation location, add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<your_custom_location>` to the CMake invocation;
the default is an intrusive, system-wide `/usr/local` on UNIX-like systems.

The CMake invocation also adds a reference to the build tree location to the user-level CMake cache.
This means that the `find_package()` call can also work without installation, and will find then find the build tree
itself. 

### Dependencies

**selene** uses the following (optional) third-party dependencies for implementing some of its functionality:

  - [libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/) or [libjpeg-turbo](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo) (preferred):
    - Optional, but recommended
    - Required for the JPEG reading and writing API
    - `libjpeg-turbo` is the preferred version of the library
  - [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html):
    - Optional, but recommended
    - Required for the PNG reading and writing API
  - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/):
    - Optional, if needed
    - For OpenCV interoperability (e.g. copying or wrapping image data)

The presence (or lack of) these dependencies should be detected automatically by CMake.

If [libjpeg-turbo](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo) is present on the system, some of its additional
capabilities (such as partial JPEG image decoding and extended color spaces) will be taken into account and are enabled
by the API.

[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is only needed for converting between `sln::Image<T>` and OpenCV's `cv::Mat` structure, if
so desired.

To point CMake to custom library installation locations, set the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` environment variable accordingly.
For example, `export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/local/libjpeg-turbo:$HOME/local/libpng`. 

### Building and running tests, examples, and benchmarks

#### Tests

    -DSELENE_BUILD_TESTS=ON

Building the tests is disabled by default, and can be enabled by adding `-DSELENE_BUILD_TESTS=ON` to the `cmake`
command.

The test suite depends on [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) and [Boost.Filesystem](http://www.boost.org/) for
building the tests.
The former is bundled as a Git submodule and will be automatically cloned during execution of the `cmake` command.
The latter is automatically searched for by a CMake `find_package` command; its presence is required to build the tests.

The test suite can be run by executing `./test/selene_tests` from the `build` directory. `./test/selene_tests -h` lists
available options. See the [Catch2 documentation](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/command-line.md)
for more information.

#### Examples

    -DSELENE_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON

The repository also contains commented examples which can be optionally compiled.
This can be enabled by adding `-DSELENE_BUILD_TESTS=ON` to the `cmake` command.
The examples can then be found in the `./examples/` folder in the build directory.

#### Benchmarks

    -DSELENE_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON

A few micro-benchmarks can be optionally compiled by adding `-DSELENE_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON` to the `cmake` command line.
The code for these can be found in the `./benchmark/` folder, and depends on Google's
[benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) library to be installed.

#### Specifying the data path

In case some tests or examples are failing because auxiliary data files can not be found automatically, specify the path
to the `data` directory inside the `selene/` folder manually: `SELENE_DATA_PATH=../data ./test/selene_tests` (or
similar).

### Installing dependencies

The following are recommendations for installation of dependencies on various platforms.
Of course any dependency can alternatively also be built and installed from source, as long as it can be found by the
CMake `find_package` command.

#### Linux

On Debian-like systems (e.g. Ubuntu), you should be able to use `apt-get` as follows:

    apt-get install libjpeg-turbo8-dev libpng-dev libopencv-dev libboost-filesystem-dev

#### MacOS

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to build and install the dependencies as follows:

    brew install libjpeg-turbo libpng opencv3 boost

#### Windows

By far the easiest way is to install and then use the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) package manager:

    .\vcpkg.exe install libjpeg-turbo
    .\vcpkg.exe install libpng
    .\vcpkg.exe install opencv
    .\vcpkg.exe install boost

Set the system environment variable `VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET=x64-windows` before installing the above packages to install
the 64-bit compiled versions instead of the 32-bit ones.
