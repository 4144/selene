# Selene

**Early preview release**

## Introduction

**selene** is a C++14 image representation, processing and I/O library.

It currently contains, among other things

  * Statically and dynamically typed in-memory pixel and image data representations.
  	* [Pixel<T, n>](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/Pixel.hpp): Statically typed multi-channel pixel value. For example, `Pixel<std:uint8_t, 3>` (shortcut: `Pixel_8u3`) can represent an 8-bit RGB value.
  	* [Image<T>](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/Image.hpp): Statically typed class representing a 2-D image. For example `Image<Pixel_8u1>` can represent an 8-bit grayscale image.
  	* [ImageData](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/ImageData.hpp): Dynamically typed class representing a 2-D image.
  	* Interoperability with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) `cv::Mat` matrices: both wrapping (as view) or copying is supported, in both directions. 
  * Functions for reading and writing image data in JPEG and PNG formats (from/to files or memory).
  	* [read_jpeg()](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/JPEGRead.hpp), [read_jpeg_header()](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/JPEGRead.hpp)
  	* [read_png()](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/PNGRead.hpp), [read_png_header()](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/PNGRead.hpp)
  	* [write_jpeg()](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/JPEGWrite.hpp)
  	* [write_png()](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/PNGWrite.hpp)
  	* Convenience functions [read_image()](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/IO.hpp) and [write_image()](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/IO.hpp), being able to handle both formats.
  	  * Example: `auto img_data = read_image(FileReader("image.png"));`
  	  * Example: `auto img_data = read_image(MemoryReader(data, size));`
  * Basic image processing functionality, such as:
    * Image [pixel access](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/ImageAccess.hpp) using various [interpolation algorithms](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/Interpolators.hpp) (nearest neighbor, bilinear) and [boundary handling strategies](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/Accessors.hpp) (no check, replicate boundary, zero padding).
      * Example: `const auto x = get<ImageInterpolationMode::Bilinear>(img, 8.5, 10.2);`
    * [Algorithms](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/Algorithms.hpp) to apply pointwise operations to images/views.
      * Example: `for_each_pixel(img, [](auto& px){ px += 1; });`
    * [Pixel-level](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/PixelConversions.hpp) and [image-level](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/img/ImageConversions.hpp) conversion functions between different pixel formats (e.g. RGB -> Grayscale, etc.).
      * Example: `const auto gray_img = convert_image<PixelFormat::RGB, PixelFormat::Y>(rgb_img);`
  * Functions for binary IO from and to files or memory. The type of source/sink can be transparent to users of this functionality, via static polymorphism.
    * [FileReader](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/io/FileReader.hpp)/[FileWriter](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/io/FileWriter.hpp): Reading/writing from and to files
    * [MemoryReader](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/io/MemoryReader.hpp)/[MemoryWriter](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/io/MemoryWriter.hpp): Reading/writing from and to memory (raw pointer locations)
    * [VectorReader](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/io/VectorReader.hpp)/[VectorWriter](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/io/VectorWriter.hpp): Reading/writing from and to `std::vector<std::uint8_t>`, extending as needed when writing
  * A simple thread pool, to enable task-based parallelism.
    * [ThreadPool](https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene/blob/master/src/selene/thread/ThreadPool.hpp): Concurrent processing of tasks (function calls).

## Building

**selene** uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for building.

Follow the usual instructions for CMake projects on UNIX-like systems.
First, clone the project and create a `build` directory (or use another name).

    git clone https://github.com/kmhofmann/selene.git
    cd selene
    mkdir build && cd build

Then call `cmake` and build the project. Using [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make

Or, alternatively, using [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/):

    cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    ninja

Preferably use the library "at head", e.g. as submodule, instead of invoking the `install` target.

Integrating the library into own CMake projects can be as easy as:

    # ...
    add_subdirectory(selene)
    target_link_libraries(target_name selene::selene)
    # ...

The default settings will build a set of static libraries.
If you want to build shared libraries instead, add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` to the `cmake` command. 

### Dependencies

**selene** uses the following (optional) third-party dependencies for implementing some of its functionality:

  - [libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/) or [libjpeg-turbo](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo):
    - Optional, but recommended
    - Required for the JPEG reading and writing API
  - [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html):
    - Optional, but recommended
    - Required for the PNG reading and writing API
  - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/):
    - Optional, if needed
    - For OpenCV interoperability (e.g. copying or wrapping image data)

The presence (or lack of) these dependencies should be detected automatically by CMake.

If [libjpeg-turbo](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo) is present on the system, some of its additional
capabilities (such as partial JPEG image decoding and extended color spaces) will be taken into account and are enabled
by the API.

[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is only needed for converting between `sln::Image<T>` and OpenCV's `cv::Mat` structure, if
so desired.

### Building and running the tests

Building the tests is disabled by default, and can be enabled by adding `-DENABLE_SELENE_TESTS=ON` to the `cmake`
command.

The test suite depends on [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) and [Boost.Filesystem](http://www.boost.org/) for
building the tests.
The former is bundled as a Git submodule and will be automatically cloned during execution of the `cmake` command.
The latter is automatically searched for by a CMake `find_package` command; its presence is required to build the tests.

The test suite can be run by executing `./test/selene_tests` from the `build` directory. `./test/selene_tests -h` lists
available options. See the [Catch2 documentation](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/command-line.md)
for more information.

In case some tests are failing because auxiliary data files can not be found automatically, specify the path to the
`data` directory inside the `selene/` folder manually: `SELENE_DATA_PATH=../data ./test/selene_tests` (or similar).

### Installing dependencies

The following are recommendations for installation of dependencies on various platforms.
Of course any dependency can alternatively also be built from source.

#### Linux

On Debian-like systems (e.g. Ubuntu), you should be able to use `apt-get` as follows:

    apt-get install libjpeg-turbo8-dev libpng16-dev libopencv-dev libboost-filesystem-dev

However, OpenCV might need to be built from source and installed manually.

#### MacOS

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to build and install the dependencies as follows:

    brew install libjpeg-turbo libpng opencv3 boost

#### Windows

By far the easiest way is to install and then use the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) package manager:

    .\vcpkg.exe install libjpeg-turbo
    .\vcpkg.exe install libpng
    .\vcpkg.exe install opencv
    .\vcpkg.exe install boost

## Documentation

**selene** is fully documented using the [_Doxygen_](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) format.
_Doxygen_ documentation can be built using the provided `Doxyfile`.
Simply run `doxygen` in the main library directory.

A regularly updated version of the documentation [is hosted here](https://michael-hofmann.info/selene/).

While the Doxygen API documentation might provide a decent reference manual, there is currently a lack of usage
tutorials and examples.
More of these shall be added in the near future.

## Rationale

Why implement a new library for image representation, I/O and basic processing?
It seems that existing solutions are somewhat lacking.

Many C++ developers who quickly want to read or write image data for processing purposes, in particular in research,
fall back to using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

OpenCV, however, is not only a heavy-weight solution from a binary size perspective; the interfaces it provides are
also notoriously type-unsafe and do not generalize well.
It has heaps of scaffolding and questionable abstractions to hide C code from 20 years ago.
Examples:

- Ever wondered how to access a pixel inside a `cv::Mat` correctly?
Making a mistake here is far too easy, as the image data type has to be decided at each point of access.
- Ever looked what lurks behind a `cv::InputArray` that so many functions like to take, or why it can be
substituted by a `cv::InputArrayOfArrays`?
Yep, there's a `void*` somewhere at the end of it.
Good-bye type safety!

Another option for C++ developers to read or write image data is to use the reference implementations for common formats
directly; e.g. [libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/) or [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html).

This is also notoriously difficult to get right, because although these libraries are very well documented, their C
interfaces are very low-level, require lots of boilerplate code, and provide even less type safety.
Error handling even needs to be implemented using `setjmp` and `longjmp`!
And even if one gets all this right, the result is still a block of memory with decoded image data; there is no unifying
image representation class.

**selene** aims to fill this gap by providing an easy to use API for the most common image I/O and processing needs.
See the feature set above.

Its goal is to provide a wide-enough feature set to be able to _build_ more complex functionality _on top_.
It is not meant as a competitor to OpenCV's more specialized computer vision algorithms, and it does not aim to be a
jack of all trades, master of none.

Primary design criteria for the library are:
- Ease of use ("easy to use correctly, hard to use incorrectly")
- Sane and minimal interfaces
- Type safety
- Modularity

The library might lack some much-needed features in its current state (such as image rescaling), but it is planned to
add these over time.

## Status

**selene** is work-in-progress and shall be considerably extended and modified in the future.
Currently, no API or ABI stability guarantees are given.
However, the code is well-tested and assumed to be not too far from production-level quality.
Porting to accommodate potential API changes should not be very difficult.

While performance is important, and premature pessimization is avoided wherever possible, some of the provided
operations could be further sped up by explicit vectorization. As the library currently has one main author working on
it in his free time, this is deemed out of scope at the moment.

**selene** is currently developed and tested on
- Linux using GCC 7.2.0 and Clang 6.0.0 (trunk)
- MacOS using AppleClang 9.0.0.
- Windows using Visual C++ 2017 (compiler version >= 19.12.25831).
